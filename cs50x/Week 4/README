== Recover ==
Recover is a C program that scans a raw memory card image to recover JPEGs that may have been deleted. It identifies JPEG signatures, extracts image data block by block, and writes each file to a new JPEG. The program demonstrates file I/O, byte-level memory manipulation, and pattern recognition in raw binary data.

== Volume ==
Volume is a C program that adjusts the volume of an audio file in WAV format by scaling its sample amplitudes. It reads the fileâ€™s headers and audio data, applies a user-specified multiplier to each sample, and writes the modified data to a new file. The project involves binary file manipulation and understanding of the WAV file structure.
