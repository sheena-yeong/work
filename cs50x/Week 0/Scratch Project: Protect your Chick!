For Week 0 of CS50x, I built a simple interactive project using Scratch. 
It uses basic programming principles like loops, conditionals, and event-driven behavior, all through a visual interface. 
The goal was to get familiar with computational thinking without writing code directly.
This was completed as part of Harvard's CS50x curriculum.
