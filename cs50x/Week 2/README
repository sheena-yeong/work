==Readability==
Readability is a C program that implements the Coleman-Liau index to estimate the U.S. grade level required to understand a given text. 
It analyzes the number of letters, words, and sentences to calculate a score, then outputs a corresponding grade level (e.g., "Grade 6"). 

==Scrabble==
The program calculates the score of a given word based on Scrabble letter values. 
It uses arrays to store letter-point mappings and iterates through the word to compute its total score.

==Substitution==
This program implements a simple substitution cipher that encrypts plaintext by replacing each letter with a corresponding letter from a scrambled alphabet. 
It includes validation checks to ensure the key is properly formatted and handles edge cases, like repeated letters or non-alphabetic characters.
